# Contributing to Documentation for MusicBrainz Picard

This documentation project only exists because of the volunteer effort that goes into its development,
from the initial documentation on the Picard website, the information posted in the
[Community Discussion Forum](https://community.metabrainz.org/), documentation from scripts, plugins
and program source code, proofreaders, editors, translators, and feedback from the user community.
Individual contributors are not being listed here for fear of missing someone; however, please know
that your contributions are greatly appreciated.

If you want to contribute corrections or new material to this documentation project, please initiate
a [Pull Request](https://github.com/rdswift/picard-docs/pulls) to submit the changes for review and
implementation.  All documentation is included in the form of restructured text files (*.rst) found
in the *"source"* directory.  This directory also contains some subdirectories to help organize the
information into logical groups.  The *"index.rst"* file contains the top level document index for
the HTML output, and the *"pdf.rst"* file contains the document index for the PDF output.
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) is used to produce the final output documents.

The source documentation has been developed in the English language.  Please contact us if you are
interested in helping to work on translating the documentation to other languages, or would like to
contribute in some other manner.

Thank-you for considering contributing to this documentation project.
