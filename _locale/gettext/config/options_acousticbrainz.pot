msgid "Beginning with v2.7, Picard can analyze music files and submit the information to `AcousticBrainz <https://acousticbrainz.org/>`_. Information can only be submitted if the file is properly tagged with MusicBrainz identifiers.  In order to provide this functionality Picard must be provided with a link to an appropriate extraction application.  If no link is provided, Picard will attempt to find an extractor in the application directory."
