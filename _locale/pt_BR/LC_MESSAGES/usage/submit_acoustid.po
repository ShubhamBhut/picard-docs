"Acoustic fingerprints are very useful for identifying tracks and "
"recordings, allowing them to be looked up in the MusicBrainz database. "
"Thus, it is very valuable to add them when you are tagging files.  Note "
"that an acoustic fingerprint is **not** an AcoustID. Please see the "

"When using Picard to submit acoustic fingerprints, it is recommended to "
"enable the Fingerprint column in the table view in the right-hand pane.  "
"This is done by right-clicking the column header and checking the box "
"beside \"Fingerprint status\".  This will display an icon indicating "
"whether the AcoustID was calculated and whether it ready for submission "
"(red = unsubmitted, grey = already submitted)."

"There are two methods for submitting acoustic fingerprints, depending on "
"the workflow that you are using to identify the releases that you are "
"tagging. Note that both methods require that you first match your audio "
"files to release and track information from the MusicBrainz database. See"
" the :doc:`retrieve` and :doc:`match` sections for more information about"
" retrieving release information and matching audio files to releases."
