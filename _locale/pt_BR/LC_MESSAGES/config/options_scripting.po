msgid "Regardless of whether or not the script is executed automatically, it can also be executed manually by right-clicking on an item in the clustering pane (middle pane) or the tagging pane (right-hand pane) and selecting it from the list displayed when :menuselection:`\"Run Scripts\"` is selected.  If a cluster is selected in the middle pane or a release is selected in the right-hand pane, the script will be executed for each track in the selected cluster or release.  If only a single track or file is selected, then the script will only be executed for that track or file."
