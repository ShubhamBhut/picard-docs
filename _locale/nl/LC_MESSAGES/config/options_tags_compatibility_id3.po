"Although ID3v2.4 is the latest version, its support in music players is "

" others may not be able to read the tags and display the information. "
"Support for ID3v2.4 in other media players (such as smartphones) is "

"As mentioned above, ID3v2.3 does not support multi-value tags, and so "
"Picard flattens these to strings before saving them to ID3v2.3 tags. This"
" setting defines the string used to separate the values when flattened. "
"Use '; ' for the greatest compatibility (rather than '/' since tags more "
"often contain a '/' than a ';') and for the best visual compatibility in "
"Picard between ID3v2.3 and other tagging formats."

"This setting is explicitly only for ID3 v2.3 tags, because those donâ€™t "
"support proper multi value tags. Hence this separator setting is actually"
" more of a workaround to this fact."

msgid ""
"Because Vorbis tags allow the same tag to exist multiple times, and hence"
" support multi valued tags by default, there actually is no separator at "
"all there. It is just multiple values, shown using whatever the player "
"software uses as a separator."

"If for some reason you want all the values of the tag in a single field "
