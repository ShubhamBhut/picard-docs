"Pads the ``text`` to the ``length`` provided by adding as many copies of "
"``char`` as needed to the beginning of the string.  For the padded length"

"``length`` is less than the number of characters in ``text``, the "
"function will return ``text``.  If ``length`` is missing or is not a "
"number, the function will return \"\"."
