#: ../../source/faq/faq_file_formats.rst:66

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/faq_file_formats.rst:67
msgid "encouraging users to create an account and fix and update data via the MusicBrainz website, thus sharing their work with the rest of the community rather than simply fixing their tags locally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/faq_file_formats.rst:70
msgid "To that end, Picard is likely to never have as much development focus on manual bulk editing of tags as other general purpose editors (e.g.: `Mp3tag <https://www.mp3tag.de/en/>`_, `foobar2000 <https://www.foobar2000.org/>`_, or even many library managers such as iTunes, Windows Media Player, and MediaMonkey).

msgid "Acoustic fingerprinting in Picard uses a tool called ``fpcalc``, which is not available in Fedora. You can get it by installing the chromaprint-toolspackage from the `RPM Fusion repository <https://rpmfusion.org/>`_. This functionality is not contained in the main Fedora ``picard`` package because it requires the ``ffmpeg`` package which `cannot be distributed by Fedora <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Forbidden_items>`_.
