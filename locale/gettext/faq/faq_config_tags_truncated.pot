msgid "Windows Media Player (WMP) can only read ID3v2.3 tags. If you have tagged your files with ID3v2.4 WMP falls back to ID3v1 which has a limitation of 30 characters per title. Writing ID3v2.3 is the default, but you can configure it in the :doc:`tag options for ID3 <../config/options_tags_compatibility_id3>`."
