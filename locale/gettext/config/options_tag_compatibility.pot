msgid "Although ID3v2.4 is the latest version, its support in music players is still lacking. While software such as `foobar2000 <https://www.foobar2000.org/>`_ and `MediaMonkey <https://www.mediamonkey.com/>`_ have no problem using version 2.4 tags, you will not be able to read the tags in Windows Explorer or Windows Media Player (in any Windows or WMP version). Apple iTunes is also still based in ID3v2.3, and support for ID3v2.4 in other media players (such as smartphones) is variable. Other than native support for multi-valued tags in v2.4, the `Picard Tag Mapping <https://picard.musicbrainz.org/docs/mappings/>`_ will show you what you lose when choosing v2.3 instead of v2.4."

msgid "As mentioned above, ID3v2.3 does not support multi-value tags, and so Picard flattens these to strings before saving them to ID3v2.3 tags. This setting defines the string used to separate the values when flattened. Use '; ' for the greatest compatibility (rather than '/' since tags more often contain a '/' than a ';') and for the best visual compatibility in Picard between ID3v2.3 and other tagging formats."

APEv2 tags in AAC or AC3 are supported by some players (e.g.: foobar2000 or MusicBee), but players not supporting AAC or AC3 files with APEv2 tags can have issues loading and playing those files. Most often they display a wrong duration, causing issues on track change. To deal with this you can choose whether to save tags to those files:"
