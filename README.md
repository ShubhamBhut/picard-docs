# Documentation for MusicBrainz Picard

This project was created with the intent of eventually developing a comprehensive
user manual for [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org), a full-featured
music file tagging system using metadata from [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org).

It is not intended to replace the documentation on the Picard website, but to augment
it with additional detail and a structured approach.

The project currently produces the on-line documentation in [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org)
format theme using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).  The latest official build
of the Picard documentation can be viewed on the [web page](https://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/rdswift/picard-docs/blob/master/docs/index.html).
